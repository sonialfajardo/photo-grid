# photo-grid

This web page shows a grid of photo thumbnails. Photos are fetched using the Flickr search API. 
When a thumbnail is clicked, the photo is displayed in a lightbox container. You can use the arrow buttons, or the arrow keys, in order to move to the next or previous photos.
You can close the lightbox with the close button, "X", and also with the `esc` key.
You can enter a search term in the search field to update the photo grid with corresponding photos.

Please note that you need to use your own Flickr API key in order for the requests to work. You can update the variable `flickrKey` in the file `phot-grid.js` to add your own.

Code was written only in native JavaScript.
